==========================

.. currentmodule:: mpl_toolkits

.. note::
   AxesGrid has been a part of matplotlib since v 0.99. Originally, the toolkit
   used the *axes_grid* namespace. In more recent versions, the toolkit
   has been split into *axes_grid1* and *axisartist*.  While *axes_grid*
   is maintained for the backward compatibility, use of *axes_grid1* and
   *axisartist* is recommended.  For the documentation on ``axes_grid``, see
   the `previous version of the docs`__.
